# Unsupervised Machine Learning


In the previous sections we covered the basics of supervised machine learning. However, it is not always the case that we are interested in a problem were we want to predict labels, or values, of a given variable. We often face problems with structured data
where we do not have labels and we want to extract features from this observations. In this session, we introduce the basic concepts of unsupervised machine learning and we cover some topics on clustering and dimensionality reduction.
