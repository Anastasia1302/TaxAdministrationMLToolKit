# Fiscal Management Division - Data analytics Toolkit for Tax Administration

This toolkit provides some examples of machine learning projects to be used by tax administrations for different purposes. The examples include supervised learning methods for classification and regression as well as unsupervised methods for anomaly detection. The code is in R and Python but can be easily adapted to other programming languages. A fake generated dataset is used for illustrative purposes in each of the algorithms.

If you are not familiar with the general Machine Learning methodology, we invite you to take a look at the course  ["Machine Learning For All"](https://idbg.sharepoint.com/sites/EVP/MLPA/Pages/Learning.aspx) taught by Rodrigo Azuero, Selina Carter, Cesar Montiel, and Ana Yagygina at the Inter-American Development Bank. In the website you will find videos, presentations, and code that will help you better understand the Machine Learning methodologies. 
The material presented here was all developed by Rodrigo Azuero, Cesar Montial, and Anastasia Yarygina.
