# Fiscal Management Division - Machine Learning Toolkit for Tax Administrations

This toolkit provides some examples of machine learning projects to be used by tax administrations for different purposes. The examples include supervised learning methods for classification and regression as well as unsupervised methods for anomaly detection. The code is in R but can be easily adapted to other programming languages. A fake generated dataset is used for illustrative purposes in each of the algorithms.

If you are not familiar with the general Machine Learning methodology, I invite you to take a look at the course  ["Machine Learning For All"](https://idbg.sharepoint.com/sites/EVP/MLPA/Pages/Learning.aspx) taught by Rodrigo Azuero, Selina Carter. , Cesar Montiel, and Ana Yagygina at the Inter-American Development Bank. In the website you will find videos, presentations, and code that will help you better understand the Machine Learning methodologies.
